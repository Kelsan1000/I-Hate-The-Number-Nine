 Project 06 I Hate The Number 9
 Description: 
 This program reads in a file from standard input containing the amount 
 of cases and how many digits each case has. It checks how many positive 
 numbers that do not contain the number 9. We were not allowed to write in
 python, use the BigInteger class and had to obtain proof from Open Kattis.
